# MJ-API-Styleguide
Styleguide on how to implement APIs

# Introduction
The Mailjet platform is a collection of reusable services that encapsulate well-defined business capabilities. Developers are encouraged to access these capabilities through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that enable consistent design patterns and principles. This facilitates a great developer experience and the ability to quickly compose complex business processes by combining multiple, complementary capabilities as building blocks.

Mailjet APIs follow the [RESTful][https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm] architectural style as much as possible. To support our objectives, we will develop a set of rules, standards, and conventions that apply to the design of RESTful APIs. These will be used to help design and maintain hundreds of APIs that have evolved over several years to meet the needs of a wide variety of use cases.

We are working on these guidelines to ensure good API design practices in future projects led within Mailjet's organization. We have pulled extensively from the broader community and believe that it is important to give back. The documentation is as generic as possible to make it easier to incorporate into the guidelines you use in your projects. If you have any updates, suggestions, or additions that you would like to contribute, please feel free to submit a PR or create an issue.
