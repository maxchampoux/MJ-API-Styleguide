# MJ-API-Styleguide
Styleguide on how to implement APIs

# Introduction
As part of the team guiding the engineering-wide project, the API Design team has already and will continue to work with a huge number of development teams with the objective to ensure the broadest consistency in API design, sound usability and a myriad of other concerns.

The goal of this styleguide is while collaborating on new projects, to detail a set of internal standards when dealing with API designs.
